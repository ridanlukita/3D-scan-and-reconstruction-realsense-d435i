Error (3101): calibration has been cancelled due to timeout! 
If you prefer, try longer timeout in seconds using the -o option on the command line or the advanced settings in GUI.
It's likely the device is severely shifted and hard for dynamic calibrator to recover. 
Please try latest technician calibration tool.
